# Security Implementation Guide

## ðŸ”’ Security Features Implemented

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Film Loca application to ensure user data protection, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain system integrity.

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

#### 1. **Profile Data Minimization**
- **Issue Fixed**: Overly permissive profile access allowing exposure of personal data
- **Solution**: Implemented data minimization policies
  - Property owners can only see essential contact info (name, phone) during active bookings
  - Renters can only see property owner name and company during active/completed bookings
  - All sensitive data (addresses, bio, etc.) is restricted

#### 2. **Financial Data Protection**
- **Issue Fixed**: Payment IDs and commission data exposed to property owners
- **Solution**: Created secure view `bookings_for_owners` that excludes:
  - Payment IDs
  - Commission amounts
  - Commission rates
- **Implementation**: Property owners use secure view, booking owners access full table

#### 3. **Admin User Security**
- **Issue Fixed**: Infinite recursion in admin policies
- **Solution**: Created secure `is_admin_user()` function using SECURITY DEFINER
- **Features**: Bulletproof admin verification without policy recursion

#### 4. **Message Security Enhancement**
- **Issue Fixed**: Private messages potentially containing sensitive data
- **Solution**: Added sensitive content detection function
- **Features**: Automatic flagging of messages containing financial terms

### Security Audit System

#### Audit Logging Table
```sql
security_audit_log (
  id, user_id, action, table_name, record_id, 
  sensitive_data_accessed, ip_address, user_agent, created_at
)
```

#### Monitored Actions
- Profile access
- Financial data access
- Admin actions
- Sensitive message viewing
- Property management operations

## Application Security Features

### 1. **Secure Hooks and Functions**

#### `useSecureBookings`
- Uses secure view for property owners
- Prevents exposure of financial data
- Implements proper access controls

#### `useSecureProfile`
- Calls `get_minimal_profile_info()` function
- Returns only necessary profile data based on business relationship
- Implements data minimization principles

#### `useSecureOperation`
- Wraps sensitive operations with authentication checks
- Provides consistent error handling
- Prevents sensitive error exposure

### 2. **Security Components**

#### `SecureDataDisplay`
- Automatically logs access to sensitive data
- Wraps sensitive UI components
- Provides audit trail for compliance

#### `RateLimitedButton`
- Prevents rapid-fire requests
- Configurable rate limiting per component
- User-friendly feedback on rate limits

#### `SecureForm`
- CSRF token generation and validation
- Input sanitization
- Secure form submission handling

### 3. **Edge Function Security**

#### Enhanced Input Validation
- UUID format validation
- Date range validation
- Numeric bounds checking
- String length limits

#### Error Message Sanitization
- Generic error messages for security
- Detailed logging for debugging
- No sensitive information exposure

#### Rate Limiting
- IP-based tracking
- Configurable limits per endpoint
- Automatic blocking of suspicious activity

### 4. **Data Sanitization**

#### Content Sanitization
```typescript
sanitizeForDisplay() // HTML entity encoding
sanitizeSensitiveInfo() // PII detection and masking
```

#### Features
- Credit card number masking
- SSN protection
- Email masking in content
- Phone number protection

## Authentication Security

### Supabase Auth Configuration
- Proper email redirect URL validation
- Session timeout configuration
- Token refresh security
- Password strength requirements

### Frontend Auth Security
- Secure session management
- Proper authentication state handling
- Protected route implementation
- Automatic session cleanup

## Error Handling & Monitoring

### Error Boundary Implementation
- React error boundary for graceful error handling
- Security-conscious error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Development vs production error details

### Security Monitoring
- Audit trail for all sensitive operations
- Failed authentication attempt logging
- Suspicious activity detection
- Compliance reporting capabilities

## Deployment Security

### Environment Variables
- Secure API key management
- Proper secret separation
- Production vs development configurations

### Build Security
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint security rules
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Compliance Features

### Data Protection
- GDPR-compliant data minimization
- User data export capabilities
- Right to deletion implementation
- Consent management

### Audit Requirements
- Complete audit trail
- Sensitive data access logging
- Admin action monitoring
- Compliance reporting

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Users see only necessary data
   - Granular access controls
   - Role-based permissions

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple security layers
   - Client and server-side validation
   - Database-level security

3. **Secure by Default**
   - All new features include security measures
   - Default deny access policies
   - Explicit permission grants

4. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - Complete audit logging
   - User action tracking
   - Administrative oversight

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Enable Supabase leaked password protection
- [ ] Configure proper OTP expiry times
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Enable database backup encryption

- [ ] Enable HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. Immediate containment
2. Impact assessment
3. Evidence preservation
4. User notification (if required)
5. System restoration
6. Post-incident review
